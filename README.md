This is my personal Neovim configuration for front-end development, built on top of [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim), a modular and fast Neovim setup powered by lazy-loading.

## Features

- 🚀 Fast startup with lazy-loaded plugins
- 🧠 LSP support for intelligent code completion, diagnostics, and code actions
- 🌈 Treesitter-based syntax highlighting and code navigation
- 🛠️ Pre-configured keymaps and commands for productivity
- 📦 Easy plugin management with [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
- 📝 Customizable to fit your workflow

## Installation

Refer to the [LazyVim documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) for installation instructions.

Clone this repo into your Neovim config directory:

```sh
git clone <this-repo-url> ~/.config/nvim
```

## Customization

Edit the files in this directory to tweak plugins, keymaps, and settings to your liking. See the `lua/` folder for configuration modules.
